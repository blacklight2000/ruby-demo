The fibonacci algorithms is written in five different ways.
We are demonstrating that the non-recursive algorithm is far speedier 
than any of the recursive algorithms.

The fibonaci algorithms algorithms are unit tested for logical
integrity i.e. correct results are delivered and a performance test 
on these algorithms is performed.
